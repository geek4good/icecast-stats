# Podcast hosting

I've looked into different podcast hosting platforms to get an idea of feature sets and pricing.

All of them offer similar features like publishing to other services like Apple Podcasts and Spotify, your own website with custom domain and embedded player, monetisation through ads they provide, automatic mastering and transcription services, stats (e.g., total downloads or listener location) and even editorial / publishing workflows.

Prices are quite similar, too. Most of them start at either $12 or $19 per month and offer according annual pricing with a bit of a discount. Where they do differ is if they restrict the hours of uploaded content per month or the number of downloads per month (the different pricing tiers determine the exact numbers). Only three of the well known podcast hosts offer hosting of video files:

- Castos (https://castos.com/pricing, from $99 per month)
- PodBean (https://www.podbean.com/podcast-hosting-pricing, from $29 per month)
- Libsyn (https://libsyn.com/plans-and-pricing, from $12 per month)

This, in my opinion, leaves us with three options:

- Use one of the above three hosts that offer video hosting
- Use one the hosts for audio-only hosting and handle video separately (e.g., host on YouTube)
- Host the files ourselves, which comes with development and hosting costs, maintenance effort, and it also requires a fair bit of further research
